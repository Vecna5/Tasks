                <p class="description">
                    I started my career as a systems developer at Ticketmaster, where I worked on backend systems and got a taste of real-world software development. It was a solid job, but over time, I felt something deeper calling me something bigger than just another company’s codebase.

                        <h3>C++</h3>
                        <span>+</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>While C was my main language, I also ventured into C++ for more complex projects. C++ builds on C with features like classes and object-oriented programming, making it useful when I needed more sophisticated structures.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>C was the heart of my work, especially in creating TempleOS. It’s a powerful, low-level language that gave me precise control over the system’s performance and memory management.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Assembly was crucial for writing the most performance-critical parts of TempleOS. It’s a low-level language that talks directly to the CPU, and I used it when I needed complete control over hardware interactions.</p>

                        <p>Although TempleOS was built in C and Assembly, I knew and occasionally used Python for other tasks. Python is a high-level, easy-to-read language, and I appreciated its versatility.</p>
